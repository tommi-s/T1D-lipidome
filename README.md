# T1D-lipidome

## Introduction

This is the **living database** of **lipidomic aberrations during the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes** (T1D). The database has been collected from scientific publications that report abnormalities in the lipidome that associate with the onset of T1D. In practice, this means either (1) lipids that are aberrated in blood samples collected from persons, who are later known to have developed T1D, or (2) lipids that are associated with the deterioration of insulin secretion in blood samples collected from persons recently diagnosed with T1D.

## Citation

This database is described in the following publication. Please cite the publication, if you use the database or related code:

Lipidomic Abnormalities During the Pathogenesis of Type 1 Diabetes: a Quantitative Review. Tommi Suvitaival. Current Diabetes Reports. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11892-020-01326-8

## Database of the Publication

The database that was used in the publication was collected from eight scientific publications.

* The database can be found at [data/T1D-lipidome-database.tsv](data/T1D-lipidome-database.tsv).
* The analysis code along with output can be found at the [scripts](scripts) folder.

## Living Database

The database is also being updated, when new publications appear in the field.

* The updated database can be found at [data-updated/T1D-lipidome-database-updated.tsv](data-updated/T1D-lipidome-database-updated.tsv).
* The analysis code along with updated output can be found at the [scripts-updated](scripts) folder.

If you know of a new publication in the field and the publication reports direct lipid-specific associtions to the onset or progression of T1D, you are welcome to inform the author of the database, Tommi Suvitaival, about it. Most easily, this can be done by posting an issue to the Github repository and, alternatively, via email.
